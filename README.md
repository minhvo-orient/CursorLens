# <p align="center">CursorLens</p>

<p align="center"><strong>CursorLens is a free, open-source screen recorder and editor for creators, developers, and teams making product demos and walkthrough videos.</strong></p>

CursorLens is built on top of the excellent [OpenScreen](https://github.com/siddharthvaddem/openscreen) foundation and significantly upgraded for a stronger macOS-native capture and editing workflow.
